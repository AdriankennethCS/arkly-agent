Given a task description, write executable Python code to perform it. Return only the code.

Task: {task}

Please write Python code that:
1. Accomplishes the task description
2. Uses standard Python libraries where possible
3. Includes error handling
4. Returns or prints results as appropriate

The code will be executed in a sandboxed environment with limited access to system resources.
Make sure the code is safe and doesn't attempt to access restricted resources or perform dangerous operations.

Return only the Python code, no explanations or markdown formatting.
